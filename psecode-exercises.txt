// Exercise 1: Calculate the sum of Two Numbers

1. display "first number"
2. input first number from user and store as num1
3. display "second number"
4. input second number from user and store as num2
5. add num1 and num2 together and store as sum
6. display sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. input number
2. remainder = n % 2
3. IF remainder is not equal to 0
4. answer = odd
5. ELSE.
6. answer = even 
7. display answer

// Exercise 3:
Write pseudocode that will perform the following:

a) Read in 5 seperate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five
entered numbers
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message
describing what they are

1. input n1,n2, n3, n4, n5
2. avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
3. small = n1
4. large = n1
5. for i = 2 to 5:
6. 	if n1>ni then:
7.		small = ni
8.	if n1<ni then:
9.		large = ni
10.print("Average:", avg)
11.print("Smallest:", small)
12.print("Largest:", large)
